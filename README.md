## Project Objectives
  Know fundamental concepts and techniques of Convolutional Neural Network.
  
  Gain a broad understanding of image data.
  
  Know how to pre-process/clean the data using different data preprocessing techniques.
  
  Know how to build a web application using Flask framework.
## Project Flow
  User interacts with the UI (User Interface) to upload the image as input

  Depending on the different gesture inputs different operations are applied to the input image.

 Once model analyses the gesture, the prediction with operation applied on image is showcased on the UI.
 
 ###### To accomplish this, we have to complete all the activities and tasks listed below :-

 - Data Collection.

   - Collect the dataset or Create the dataset

 - Data Preprocessing.

    - Import the ImageDataGenerator library

    - Configure ImageDataGenerator class

    - Apply ImageDataGenerator functionality to Trainset and Testset

- Model Building

    - Import the model building Libraries

    - Initializing the model

    - Adding Input Layer

    - Adding Hidden Layer

    - Adding Output Layer

    - Configure the Learning Process

    - Training and testing the model

    - Save the Model

- Application Building

     - Create an HTML file

     - Build Python Code
